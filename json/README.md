# Lib json

This is my lib json that i used in a school project, this lib help me to use it as a database to stock users's data.

basically the `json_t` type is a `char *`, which is a already serialized json. Each time we want to add a new entry to the json, basically that same string is updated.

## Build

```make```

## Usage

Run ```make example```, the _example.c_ file propose some usage of how we would use my json library.
