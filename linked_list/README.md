# Lib linked list

This is the linked list lib that I used frequently for my school project. I compile it as a static library with my project in order to use it.

The linked list is inherently doubled linked in my lib, we can access to previous and next element with ```next``` and ```prev``` respectively.

## Build

```make```

## Usage

Run ```make example```, the _example.c_ file propose some usage of how we would use the linked list.
